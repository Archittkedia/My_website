<h3>Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries</h3>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

<p>What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The primary difference between the three countries is the state of economic development. Germany and the United States are developed economies, while India is a developing economy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The level of Household Expenditure for Germany and the United States has been relatively stable as a proportion to the total GDP at approximately 60%. Meanwhile, India starkly contrasts with these two countries, as the proportion of its Household Expenditures has decreased from 82% to 55% over 50 years. The change started in 1990, when the Indian Economy was liberalised and became a more business-friendly nation, where individuals and companies saw more opportunities and diverted capital from Consumption to Investment (GCF).</strong></p>
<p><strong>In terms of GCF, Germany has experienced a decrease in proposition by almost 10% over the last 50 years. This can be attributed to the fact that post-WW2, Germany was heaving investing into the reconstruction of its economy. After the late 1990s, when East Germany was reunified with West Germany, Investment decreased to approximately 20%, about the same level as the United States, signalling that it became a healthy economy. The United States, on the other hand, has had relatively stable investment, excluding dips in investment due to business cycles, specifically economic boom in the early 2000s and the 2009 financial crisis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Government expenditure differs by country, however, has remained relatively stable over the last 50 years. Every country has its own expectations of growth rate, and generally are able to manage their government budget as an expected percentage of GDP. Additionally, interest rates differed greatly across countries. In developing countries like India, the government’s borrowing costs were high, particularly pre-1990s. Thus, the Indian government had to be prudent in their spending patterns. With the United States being the heart and soul of capitalism, over the years, more power has been transferred to markets. Thus, this may be the reason that government expenditure has been falling in the US.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lastly, the level of net exports, defined as exports minus imports has varied across countries. In Germany, the proportion of net exports has increased significantly after the 2000s, starting from being a balanced importing and exporting nation to becoming an export-driven nation. It is possible that this change occurred due to increased goods mobility in the EU. Both India and the United States, on the other hand, have become predominantly net importers over the last few decades. This implies that the countries import a greater value of goods than they export. In India, this can be attributed to the market liberalisation. Meanwhile, the United States has the largest goods consumption in the world, which explains a growing influx in imports in recent years.</strong></p>
