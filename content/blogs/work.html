<h3>Academic Work</h3>
<p><em>Research</em>
During my Undergraduate, as my final project, my study group researched for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2JWmXFCOtEFaD7TxS-jLfmdS0NaOVWP/view?usp=sharing">The Antecedents and Lead Indicators to a Global Financial Crisis.</a></p>
<p>It was about critically analyze the various investment avenues and their
interdependencies with the stock market, in order to establish certain movements in them as
indicators for the stock market crash.</p>
<p>Multiple variables had been analyzed, with the dependent variable being the S&amp;P500 index,
as an assumption that the US has been the epicenter for most crises has been made.
A descriptive research with secondary data was carried out, correlational tools were used on
data for the last 40 years, covering 3 major crises: the 1980s recession, the dot-com bubble,
and the sub-prime mortgage crisis.
The research was successful at establishing relationships between the variables.</p>
